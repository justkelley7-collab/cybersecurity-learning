# SSH Brute-Force Log Analysis

## Scenario
A Linux server experienced unusual authentication activity.
As a penetration tester, the goal is to analyze authentication logs
to identify attack behavior and determine whether access was gained.

## Objectives
- Identify brute-force login attempts
- Determine attacker IP address
- Confirm whether a successful login occurred
- Assess potential impact

## Log Source
- Linux authentication logs (`auth.log`)
