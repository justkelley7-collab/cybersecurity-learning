# Cybersecurity Learning Journal

## About Me
I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with an Associate’s degree in Cybersecurity and am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity, focusing on defensive security, investigation, and threat analysis. This repository serves as a living record of my technical growth, hands-on experimentation, 
and structured learning across core cybersecurity domains.

My goal is to develop practical, ethical, and analytical skills that align with industry standards while building a strong foundation in system security, networking, and threat detection.

## Academic & Technical Goals
- Build strong fundamentals in networking, operating systems, and security architecture
- Apply theoretical concepts through labs, scripts, and real-world simulations
- Develop defensive security and digital forensics skills aligned with industry frameworks
- Practice ethical offensive techniques to better understand attacker methodologies

## Learning Platforms & Labs
- TryHackMe (guided learning and security pathways)
- Hack The Box Academy (technical modules and applied security concepts)
- OverTheWire (Linux and system-level security challenges)
- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and problem-solving exercises

## Current Focus Areas
- Network protocols and traffic analysis
- Linux system fundamentals and permissions
- Web application security concepts
- Threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies
- Security logging and basic forensic principles

## Progress Tracker
- [x] Intro to Cybersecurity
- [ ] Networking Fundamentals
- [ ] Linux System Administration
- [ ] Web Security Basics
- [ ] Log Analysis and Security Monitoring

## Resources & Frameworks
- OWASP Top 10
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Security documentation and technical articles
- Video lectures, walkthroughs, and lab guides 

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized to reflect both learning and application:

- **projects/** — Hands-on cybersecurity tools, scripts, and technical exercises  
- **learning-journal/** — Reflections, lab walkthroughs, and security challenge documentation  

## Philosophy
I believe strong cybersecurity professionals are built through consistency, documentation, and ethical responsibility. This repository reflects not just completed work, but the process of learning, analyzing, and improving over time.
